## Q5

Base Case:

$B_1 = A$ is not a tautology by definition, so our property holds.  
Let $P(n)$ denote that formula $B_n$ is a tautology iff $n$ is even.

So P(1) holds.

Inductive Step:

IH: $P(k)$ holds for some $k\geq 1$.

Case 1: $k$ is even

$B_{k+1} = (B_k\to A) = (1\to A)$. This is not a tautology if $A$ is false.  
Since $A$ is not a tautology then $B_{k+1}$ is not true under all truth valuations
and thus, not a tautology.

Case 2: $k$ is odd.
$B_{k+1} = (B_k\to A)$. From our IH, we know that $B_k$ is not a tautology.
Thus from the truth table of $(B_k\to A)$, $B_{k+1}$ is a tautology.

Therefore, by structural induction, $P(n)$ holds.
