The files in this directory should build into an executable that only
displays a blank canvas.

To do:
- Create a Makefile for your program.  This is a requirement.  Do it first.  It
  should build an executable called a4q2.
- Implement the Decorator pattern on the AsciiArt class hierarchy and build
  the required decorator classes. You may not change any of: asciiart.{h,cc}, studio.{h,cc}.
- Make the necessary changes to the test harness, main.cc, such that the *box commands
  create and attach the necessary decorators.  Nothing currently in the
  test harness needs to be removed or altered; you should only need to add
  code to it.
